## Problems/Things to work on
* *Heroku*
  * Heroku decided to try and destroy my mental status when it refused to build my project on the last day after building each day prior  without any issue.

* *Deciding on a technology to use*
  * Iiiiii feel like idroped the ball on this one, I spent maybe two or three days just starting and trashing projects while I attempted to implement new texch and libraries and languages. I don't think I used new resources very well.
